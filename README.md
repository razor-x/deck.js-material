Material theme for deck.js.

## Description

### Requirements

[Bower], [Bourbon], [Neat], and [deck.js].

Additionally, this theme uses the [Roboto] and [Open Sans] fonts,
so you should provide them, e.g., with [Web Font Loader].

Other dependencies are managed via Bower.
Make sure your Bower components directory is in your Sass load path.

[Bourbon]: http://bourbon.io/
[deck.js]: http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/
[Neat]: http://neat.bourbon.io/
[Open Sans]: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans
[Roboto]: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto
[Web Font Loader]: https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/webfont_loader

### Usage

This theme assumes you have already imported
Bourbon and Neat into your project.
Additionally, you should import the reset theme
included with deck.js.

For example, this will work with most modern build systems,

````sass
@import bourbon
@import neat
@import deck.js/themes/style/reset
@import deck.js-material
````
